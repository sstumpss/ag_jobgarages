## Job Garages! 🚗🏢
Job-based garages and vehicle customisation with extensive script compatibility.

Easy to configure, allowing you to completely customise where your garage menu is placed, where your customisation points can be accessed and where the vehicle spawns on selection. You can also break the garage up into separate categories, locking vehicles behind ranks and roles too. Simple design allows for ease of access by all players. 

## ✨ New Features
- **Extensive Script Compatibility**: Support for multiple vehicle keys, fuel, notification, text UI, and progress systems
- **Easy Configuration**: All compatibility settings in one place at the top of `config.lua`
- **Modular Design**: Easily add your own custom integrations
- **Future-Proof**: Prepared for additional features like target system support
